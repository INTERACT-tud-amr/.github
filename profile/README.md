## Welcome to the page of the INTERACT project.

We are part of the project INTERACT (intuitive Interaction for Robots among Humans) of the Autonomus Multi-Robots Lab lead by Javier Alonso-Mora at the TU Delft, The Netherlands.
Our vision is to create intuitive mapping, motion planning and task planning in multi-robot environments shared with humans. 
This organization is maintained by Saray, Andreu and Clarence. 
If there are any issues, comments or questions, let us know via an issue!
